# mongo-scraper

Web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news.

Whenever a user visits the Heroku deployed site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to the application database. Users are also able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are able to delete comments left on articles, and all stored comments are visible to every user.
